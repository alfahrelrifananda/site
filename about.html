    <h1>About Me</h1>
    
    <!-- <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Hi, my name is <strong>Nabillio Alfahrel Rifananda.</strong> You can call me <em>Fahrel.</em>
        I'm a fresh graduate from <strong>Vocational High School 5 Surakarta</strong> with a
        major in <strong>Software Engineering.</strong>
    </p> -->
    
    <h2>Life</h2>
    <p>
        I was born on <strong>March 3rd, 2005 in Solo, Indonesia.</strong> I've lived my
        entire life in this city, and it holds a special place in my heart.
        Everything about Solo is just wonderful. I currently live with my
        grandmother. My parents separated when I was young, and custody was
        given to my mother. However, we don't live under the same roof because
        the house isn't large enough, so she had to move to a kost (small
        apartment) with my older brother. Despite this, she visits me
        regularly and provides financial support every week. I rarely see my
        father—the last time was about a year ago. I'm uncertain about his
        current whereabouts or situation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Right now, I'm focused on becoming financially independent and
        securing employment without relying on help from my parents or
        relatives. Simply put, I really need a job.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>
        I began elementary school around 2013 at <strong>SDN Bayan,</strong> a state school. However, I encountered difficulties
        in 3rd grade when I frequently missed classes for reasons I still
        don't fully understand (probably due to laziness). This led me to
        repeat 3rd grade after taking a one-year break. During this time, I
        had to transfer to <strong>SDN Banyuagung 3</strong> because we moved to a different neighborhood
        called Banyuagung. At this new school, I performed much better—I made
        great friends, maintained good attendance, and achieved decent final
        grades.
    </p>
    <p>
        After completing elementary school, I enrolled at <strong>SMPN 3 Surakarta</strong> in 2019 for middle school. My first year went
        well until COVID-19 arrived, forcing us to study from home due to
        lockdown restrictions. I spent most of my middle school years learning
        remotely, which was disappointing since many people consider this
        period the peak of their school experience (though they might be
        exaggerating). By my final semester in 3rd grade, COVID-19
        restrictions had eased enough for us to return to school with safety
        measures like mandatory masks. I graduated middle school successfully,
        though I missed out on the traditional middle school experience that
        previous generations enjoyed.
    </p>
    <p>
        Next, I attended <strong>SMKN 5 Surakarta,</strong> a vocational high school. I
        chose this path over regular high school because I believed I needed
        to enter the workforce quickly due to my family's financial
        constraints. I thought vocational school would better prepare me for
        immediate employment (though I later realized this assumption was
        somewhat misguided). At this school, I selected Computer Science as my
        major because I had developed an interest in the field. I successfully
        completed my studies and graduated.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Work</h2>
    <p>
        My professional experience is limited to my internship at
        <strong>Digimizu Digital Management,</strong> where I worked as a Web Developer
        focusing primarily on school websites. During this six-month
        internship, I gained valuable experience and was introduced to
        WordPress for the first time. This powerful content management system
        allows for website creation without extensive coding, and I developed
        considerable expertise with this tool since our projects were built
        using WordPress.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Certificates</h2>
    <p>
        The only certificates I've got are certificates I received from my
        internship at <strong>Digimizu Digital Management.</strong>
    </p>
    
    <h2>Personal Interests</h2>
    <p>
        Beyond programming, I enjoy several hobbies including listening to
        music, watching movies, and reading books (particularly philosophical
        works).
